# Below is the code solution for this above Question :-


class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
# Strip any trailing spaces
        s = s.strip()
        
# Split the string by spaces
        words = s.split(' ')
        
# Return the length of the last word
        return len(words[-1])

solution = Solution()
print(solution.lengthOfLastWord("Hello World"))            # Output: 5
print(solution.lengthOfLastWord("   fly me   to   the moon  "))  # Output: 4
print(solution.lengthOfLastWord("luffy is still funnyjoyboy"))  # Output: 6


# This is the outcome of this above question.
