Question :- 3 [ Encapsulation ]

# [ Creating a class "Employee" to encapsulate the "Employee id" and "salary" ]

# Below is code for this Question.

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, employee_id, salary):    

        self.__employee_id = employee_id      # Initialize an employee with an ID and salary
        self.__salary = salary

    def get_employee_id(self):
      
        return self.__employee_id              #  Get the employee ID

    def get_salary(self):
        
        return self.__salary                   # Get the employee's salary.

    def set_salary(self, new_salary):
        
        if new_salary > 0:                       # Set a new salary for the employee.
            self.__salary = new_salary
            print(f"Salary updated to ${new_salary}")
        else:
            print("Invalid salary amount.")

employee = Employee(12345, 50000)
print(f"Employee ID: {employee.get_employee_id()}")
print(f"Current salary: ${employee.get_salary()}")
employee.set_salary(60000)
