Question:-1 - [ Encapsulation ]

# Question1 :- creating a class "Car" to encapsulate the "Brand" of a car. Topic - that we have discussed during the class ( 2nd Week ).

# If we execute this code.As a outcome we will get the - [ Model 5 - Tesla ]

class Car:
  def __init__(self,brand,model,year):
    self.__brand = brand  # private attribute - encapsulation
    self.model = model #public
    self.year = year #public

  def get_brand(self):#  Public method to access private attribute
    return self.__brand

  def accelerate(self):
    print(f"The {self.model} is accelerating!")

my_car = Car("Tesla","Model 5",2023)
print(my_car.model)

#print(my_car.__brand) --- wrong!

print(my_car.get_brand())
