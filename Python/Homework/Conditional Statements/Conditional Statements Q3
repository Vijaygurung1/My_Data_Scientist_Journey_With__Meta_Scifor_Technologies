# Create a "Dictionary" with day numbers and names.

# If you enter a number between 1 and 7, it will provide the corresponding day. For instance, if you input 3, it will return ‘Tuesday’ as the outcome. 

# If you enter a digit outside this range ( 0 or 10), as a outcome, it will show me [Invalid input].

    1: 'Sunday',
    2: 'Monday',
    3: 'Tuesday',
