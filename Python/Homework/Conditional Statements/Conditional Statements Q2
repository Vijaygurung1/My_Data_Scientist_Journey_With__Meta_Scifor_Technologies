# Question 2:-
{ To assign grade based on score (0-100) using nested if-else }

Below is the code for this question !

# If you enter a score of [85], As a outcome we will get the students grade - [B].
# If you enter a score of [-10], As a outcome we will get the Invalid score. Which means the score must be between [ 0 and 100 ]


def assign_grade(score):
    # Check if the score is invalid
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score. Score must be between 0 and 100."

    if score >= 90:   # Check if the score is an A
        return "A"
    
    elif score >= 80: # Check if the score is a B
        return "B"
    
    elif score >= 70:  # Check if the score is a C
        return "C"
    
    elif score >= 60:  # Check if the score is a D
        return "D"
    else:              # If the score is less than 60, it's an F
        return "F"

student_score = float(input("Enter the student's score (0-100): "))  # Ask the user for their score

print(f"The student's grade is: {assign_grade(student_score)}")       # Print the student's grade
